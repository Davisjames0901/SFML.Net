# SFML.Net - Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for .Net

[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) is a simple, fast, cross-platform and object-oriented multimedia API. It provides access to windowing, graphics, audio and network.
It is originally written in C++, and this project I am working on porting to C# (Just for fun) starting as fork of the [official bindings for .Net languages](https://github.com/SFML/SFML.Net)


## Learn
I am planning to make changes to how this works, but I would like to keep the api as close as possible to SFML (For SFML v2.5) if possible. That being said
There is no tutorial for SFML.Net, but you can use the C++ resources:
* [The official tutorials](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/)
* [The online API documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/)
* [The community wiki](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/wiki/)
* [The community forum](https://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/) (or [for French speakers](https://fr.sfml-dev.org/forums/))

Of course, you can also find the SFML.Net API documentation in the SDK.
